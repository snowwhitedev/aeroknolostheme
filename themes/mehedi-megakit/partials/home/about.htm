						<p >We say it's a much more fun and fun way to travel and it's even more efficient. We know that traveling with other friends is much easier and more enjoyable. We will learn from each other how to choose the right vehicle for us, how to power it, when to power it and why not - where to power it.

						We also want to support the community we are a part of, by helping local governments to make the transition to energy transportation more energy efficient and much healthier for the community.</p>
