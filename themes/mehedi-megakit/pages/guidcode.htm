			When discussing with electric car owners we realized that there is a code of good manners when charging. The topic is extremely useful and can make us a much more enjoyable experience when charging our electric vehicle. An article summarizes very well the situations encountered at the charging station and how to behave.

			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					It is never acceptable for the place of loading to be occupied to park. This is a firm rule, no matter how crowded a parking lot is and how rarely the charging station is used. Maybe in the past there was a parking space, now it's just loading.

			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					Electric car drivers should never leave ugly messages. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If the charging point you want to use is ICEd - the term that refers to a charging point occupied by an internal combustion engine car - then you should leave a message on the windscreen to explain the situation. The note may be firm, but it should be expressed in polite language - in a willing gesture that hopes to convince him not to make the mistake again.

			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					Do not upload unless you need to. Leave room for another EV driver who may need charging to safely complete their daily commute.

			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					Load using the properly sized power connection standard for your car. There are machines that can only load slowly and machines that can load fast on the same connection standard from fast stations. It is such an important point that we have <a href="https://www.aero.org.ro/ghiduri/cum-incarcam">an</a> entire <a href="https://www.aero.org.ro/ghiduri/cum-incarcam">article</a> dedicated to it.

				<h4 class="position-relative text-color">5. When uploading check in to the PlugShare application</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					The <a href="https://www.plugshare.com/">PlugShare</a> app lets you see which charging stations are in the area, whether they are free or busy. Many drivers rely on this app to know where to go to load the car, some are just in transit. The easiest way to announce your presence at the station is to check in the app. It is thus known that the station is working, that it is busy, and based on the model of the machine, how long the loading session will take.

			<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-12">
				<h4 class="position-relative text-color">6. Upload and start over </h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					You only occupy one charging station while your car is charging. As soon as the charging session is completed - either when the battery is full or when you have an adequate range to reach your destination comfortably - be prepared to disconnect and move your car as soon as possible, making room for another electric vehicle that wants to upload. (Many upload networks and apps can be set to notify you by email or text after the upload session is complete.)

				<h4 class="position-relative text-color">7. It's OK to ask to sign in</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					If a place of loading you need is used and you can park next to a car that is currently charging, it is OK to leave a note asking to connect the machine after the session is over. If you received such a note, honor the request. If the upload session requires a fee, you are obviously not required to activate the upload session (and bear a fee) - although that gesture will probably be returned in one day. As with any note left on the windscreen, it is recommended that you include your name and mobile number in order to be contacted.

				<h4 class="position-relative text-color">8. Do not disconnect hybrid plug-in vehicles ... </h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					A pure electric car (BEV) owner, such as a BMW i3, is NOT entitled to disconnect a plug-in hybrid, such as a Mitsubishi Outlander (PHEV) - just because the car has a backup internal combustion engine. 
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4 class="position-relative text-color">9. ... Except when the hybrid vehicle is loaded </h4>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					PlugShare has a notification feature so drivers can contact each other before logging out. Drivers should try to make contact before disconnecting.
				</p>
				<p>
					The exception from Rule no. 8 and applicable, in fact, to any other car being loaded - says that it is good for a car owner to disconnect another car, only if the first car has clearly finished loading and cannot contact the first driver by telephone. In this case, the driver disconnecting should leave a note explaining why he disconnected. The note must be grateful and include the phone number.

			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					Practice charging safely. This means proper cable management. Wrap the cord tightly on its holder and pull it so that people do not overheat or drive over it.

			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-12">
				<p>
					We like that when we load we find the station clean. Some parking lots have trash cans near the station, others 10 meters away and others do not. This is no excuse for throwing garbage on foot near the station. We can still keep our trash in the car and when we get to a trash can we throw it away.
